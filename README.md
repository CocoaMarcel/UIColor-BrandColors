# UIColor+BrandColors
**UIColor+BrandColors** is just a small Objective-C category which adds colors used by big companies.

Source of all used colors and companies: [BrandColors.net](http://brandcolors.net).

## Usage
Add the two files to your project and `#import` them.

**UIColor+BrandColors** is just a category on UIColor. So you can just call the methods like every other method in UIColor.

UIColor:
`self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem.tintColor = [UIColor blackColor];`

UIColor+BrandColors:
`self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem.tintColor = [UIColor aolColor];`

## Why?
I was bored and I wanted a convenient way to use the colors from BrandColors.net. So I just decided to make **UIColor+BrandColors**. It's nothing special but I hope it may be useful for anyone.
